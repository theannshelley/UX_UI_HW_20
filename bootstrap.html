The goal of this project was to redesign the Girls Rock Denver website to have information hierarchy, responsive design and interactive characteristics. This first case study examines the design thinking process involved with the redesign of Girls Rock Denver desktop and mobile. This project was done over a timeline of 3 weeks. The tools used were Figma, Adobe XD, Adobe Creative Suite, Miro, InVision, Maze and Google Workspace.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">STEP ONE: <span class="text-muted">RESEARCH</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">We started off our research with wanting to understand what’s important for making friendships among musically talented high school girls by focusing on three objectives: what motivates young women to join clubs/programs/groups,what makes music enjoyable for the user and What does girl empowerment mean to you. Based on our objectives, we were able to conduct user interviews with parents and their daughters. We also lead Instagram polls and Google Surveys to collect more data. The common themes we found through the various research was that the girls wanted a sense of community when joining a club and wanted a space free of judgement. Before jumping into designing, we ran a competitor analysis looking at School of Rock and Youth on Record for insight into what makes them successful. Cleaner navigation, better call to actions, and engaging photos were strengths from our competitors that we wanted to incorporate into the redesign of the Girls Rock website. In the research process, a proto persona was created, Frida Robertson. Frida is a young girl who plays instruments and wants to join a club that is inclusive and diverse. After compiling our data into an Affinity Diagram, we quickly found out that while it would be the teenagers that would be taking part in the program, a lot of the decision making and research of programs was done by the parents. We decided to shift our focus to research the parents and their perspective.  In the empathy map we started to create the persona of Sheila Roberston, Frida's mother.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">STEP TWO: <span class="text-muted">DEFINITION.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Through the research, it was found that people want community in some form. The problem is, with people having a wide range of interests, our users - teenage girls - aren’t able to find programs within their school that fulfill those interests. This causes a lot of parents to turn to outside resources to get their daughters involved in extracurricular activities that they are actually interested in. Schools aren’t offering music and arts programs due to public funding issues. Girls Rock Denver was created to promote creativity within an empowering setting focusing on music and performance. While Girls Rock is primarily led by and for women and girls, they also value diversity, inclusion, and sensitivity towards all individuals regardless of gender identity or expression. With such a powerful mission statement, we went straight to work on updating the UI of the website so that their values are prominent. We reworked the whole website from the sitemap to the actual information on each of the pages to make it easier for parents to locate the information that they need. </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">STEP THREE: <span class="text-muted">IDEATION</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Through defining the problem, we were able to ideate who the persona would be. Sheila is a 44 year old working in Public Relations, married with three daughters living in Denver, CO. She is an all-in-one super mom with a priority for her girls to be part of a community that allows them to feel safe. Because she has three kids, programs can’t be too pricey, and the location is important to accommodate for her busy lifestyle. Her main goal is to find a program that is inclusive that will allow Frida the space to be herself while pursuing her passion in music. This leads to our journey map. Sheila first looks to her daughter’s school for a music/art program but can’t find any. She searches online, and through one of her facebook groups, she finds out about Girls Rock Denver. She goes to their website and reads about their focus on diversity, inclusion and empowerment and is intrigued by what this camp offers and ends up signing her daughter up for the Summer Rock Camp. She believes it will be the perfect fit for what her daughter wants. Some of the opportunities to make this successful were to make information clear and easy to find on the site. We also wanted to design a website that was engaging for both the parent and their kid, and create opportunities for connections through a call to action. Utilizing the information gained through the user journey map, we created a user flow. Our user - Sheila, will look through HERstory and the FAQ page to get a sense of how this nonprofit was founded and what it is today. She reads about the programs offered, and decides to sign her daughter up for the Summer Rock Camp.  </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">STEP FOUR: <span class="text-muted">PROTOTYPING.</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">Next the focus went prototyping, starting with the actual navigation of the website and how it is laid out. We performed a navigation heuristic evaluation and found that while the site is functional and usable, there were too many primary labels, and the pages were all text heavy. After doing a card sort, we broke down our navigation to 5 primary labels: About, After School Program, Summer Rock Camp, Resources, and Tutorials. Next, we started the exciting process of wireframing. We each sketched out our user’s path based on our user flow and put  “frankenstein” wireframes together of the mobile and desktop versions to be tested in InVision. We had success with both prototypes, and also received feedback that helped build our mid-fi prototypes. A couple of users said that they thought the FAQ page we asked them to locate would be found in the footer, but since that wasn’t sketched out, they looked in the navigation menu. In our next iterations, we felt that including a link to the FAQ page in the footer would make it more accessible to the user.  </p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">STEP FIVE: <span class="text-muted">TESTING</span></h2>
        <p class="lead">After creating our hi-fidelity prototypes, we tested on Maze and had recorded tests for a final time. Overall, the feedback was positive and most users were successful with completing the tasks. We received feedback that while users were able to complete the tasks, they were confused by some of our buttons because they couldn’t differentiate the two. We decided to change up our wording to make clear that one was to apply for the programs, and one was to contact Girls Rock if they had further questions. Below you can see the iterations.</p>
